# Abstract
This is the second version(Beta01) of my Blog Website design. I've fixed some issues and bugs as following:
## Add some fuctions like:
 - the the writers's avatar
 - the mapbox(unfinished :sweat_smile:)
 - Cookies permission request page(~~Bugs: ain't appear sometimes~~)
 - Copyright at the homepage
 - ~~Dynamic title~~(changed to dynamic subtitle)
 - added emoji system~~but not tested yet.~~
## Bugs:
 - contents won't display at bottle of the homepage, such as "C 2021"
 - ~~things didn't sync to Github, such as the posts are invisible at homepage, titles are still default on the "Posts" page when the web is released.~~
 - The SearchBox is ~~somehow~~ unavailable
