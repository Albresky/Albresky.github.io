# introduction
## First test
 - :grinning:

of my Blog Website design. I've fixed some issues and bugs as following:
## Add some fuctions like:
 - the the writers's avatar
 - the mapbox(unfinished)
 - Cookies permission request page(Bugs: ain't appear sometimes)
 - Copyright at the homepage
 - Dynamic title
 - added emoji system, but not tested yet.
## Bugs:
 - contents won't display at bottle of the homepage, such as "C 2021"
 - things didn't sync to Github, such as the posts are invisible at homepage, titles are still default on the "Posts" page when the web is released.
 - The SearchBox is somehow unavailable
